## Graph Creation

Creating graphs is at the heart of **GraphBuilder**. You can create graphs in two ways:

1. **Visual Graph Creation**: Use our interactive tools to draw nodes and edges, and customize your graph.
2. **Input Data**: Input your graph data directly, and our tools will generate the graph for you.

## Graph Analysis

Once you've created a graph, you can analyze it using a variety of algorithms:

- **Graph Traversal**: Explore the graph using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Connected Components**: Detect and analyze connected components within the graph.
- **Shortest Path**: Find the shortest path between two nodes using algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Discover the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
- **Graph Ranking**: Analyze the ranking of nodes within the graph.
- **Maximum Flow**: Determine the maximum flow in a network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

## Learning Resources

We offer a variety of learning resources to help you understand graph theory:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to help you learn graph theory concepts.
- **Examples**: Practical examples to illustrate how graph theory is applied in real-world scenarios.
